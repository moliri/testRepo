      <p>I almost forget to talk about my hobbies.<br>love travelling with my family discovering new cultures and
        people.<br>Besides, I ciclying a lot ( when the weather allow it). One of the places I like is ciclying along
        Des Plaines Trail from Libertyville to Chicago (The Cloud Gate ) and I come back with the train.<img
